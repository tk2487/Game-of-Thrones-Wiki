After compiling and running, enter a character name for specific character details, "all" for a list of all character details, or "family tree" for a family tree of all major houses and their members. 

If you want to see a character's PLOD (percentage likelihood of death), enter "use sLinkedList" to use the linked list heap or "use MyArrayList" to use the MyArrayList heap and then type "LLTD" to see which character is the least likely to die. You can also enter "remove next" to see the next character least likely to die or "remove all" to display all characters sorted by their PLOD.

To exit the program, enter "exit"

Here is a snippet of what the family tree looks like:
